# Samsung (Revised)

Welcome to the Samsung Revised. The goal of this project was to redesign the layout and structure of the original samsung site while making improvements and allowing a better user interface for the consumers. Any images or products shown within the site are stored and taken from a MYSQL database. The whole site has been taken and put into a react app.

## Let's Get Started

1. You will need to clone the repo on to your computer either by downloading the zip or through the terminal.
2. Once you've cloned the repo, go to your text editor of choice and open the folder.
3. From there open your terminal window and make your way into the folder you just opened in the text editor.
4. When you get to the folder's location, you need to type in the command **npm i**. This will install the packages you need to allow the site to work.

## Running The Site

Once all of the node modules have installed into the Samsung folder you can now start the site and view it for yourself!
1. Make sure you are within the root directory, or folder.
2. If you are there you need to type in the command **npm start** in the terminal.
3. And that's it! Just that simple! Now you may view and explore the site as much as you one and make edits where you see fit.

## Stopping the Site

When you're done viewing the site or need to install more modules to make edits you can press **ctrl + c** in the terminal and it will prompt you with *Terminate batch job (Y/N)*, and then you press **y** to say yes you do.
